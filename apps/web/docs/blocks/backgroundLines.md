A **Backgrounds** block/component from **[Aceternity UI](/docs/blocks/aceternity)** — clean-room reimplemented for Domphy (see [methodology](/docs/blocks/methodology)). Call `backgroundLines()` with no arguments for a working demo, or edit the code below live.

::: details Implementation notes
Pure-CSS traveling-dash technique: each of the (default 40) scattered, randomly-angled/colored quadratic-curve paths gets its own analytically-approximated arc length (sampled/summed at generation time, no DOM measurement) driving a per-path stroke-dasharray + per-path @keyframes stroke-dashoffset animation, so a short dash travels each path and loops seamlessly, staggered per path — matching the spec's confirmed-via-screenshot 'isolated traveling dash, not a full drawn curve' look. Palette is exposed as a broad 9-role ThemeColor set (this theme's built-in 'rainbow-ish' families) rather than literal hex, per doctor rules. Note: SVG's `pathLength` normalization attribute was deliberately avoided after discovering it isn't in this framework's small curated CamelAttributes allowlist (would silently render as the wrong-cased, non-functional `path-length`) — the analytic-arc-length + per-path-keyframes approach sidesteps that gap entirely and was verified to compile/render correctly.
