A **Charts** block/component from **[shadcn/ui](/docs/blocks/shadcn)** — clean-room reimplemented for Domphy (see [methodology](/docs/blocks/methodology)). Call `chartPieStacked()` with no arguments for a working demo, or edit the code below live.

::: details Implementation notes
Two concentric rings (inner 30-&gt;56, outer 56-&gt;86 viewBox units, contiguous with no gap band) share the same category order and index-based color mapping so both rings visibly agree per category; each ring's own metric normalizes its own 360 degrees independently (own judgment — the spec did not require synchronized angles across rings, only radial continuity). Tooltip uses a thin line marker instead of a filled swatch and prefixes the category with the ring's own series label (e.g. 'Sessions'), per spec. Same mount-sweep approximation caveat as chartPieSimple.
